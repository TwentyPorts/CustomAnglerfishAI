* Size (%) - how big anglerfish are. Doesn't affect light size. Going too high WILL cause a disaster. *Default is 100.*
* Move Speed (%) - how fast anglerfish move. This affects chase speed, investigate speed, and acceleration. *Default is 100.*
* Turn Speed (%) - how fast anglerfish rotate. This affects turn speed (while moving) and quick turn speed (while in place). *Default is 100.*
* Distance (%) - how far anglerfish can be before making certain state changes. This affects arrival distance (investigate -> lurk), pursue distance (any state -> chase), and escape distance (chase -> lurk). *Default is 100.*
* Deaf - anglerfish no longer hear you, making Dark Bramble a lot more safe :). Though if you're already being chased, turning this on won't stop them from chasing you.
* Mute - anglerfish no longer make sounds, becoming the perfect ambush predator (besides the big glowing light).
* Afraid - anglerfish flee from your intimidating presence.
* Spin Axis - spins the anglerfish 'round an axis. Spin speed depends on Quick Turn Speed. *Default is None.*
  * Values are X, Y, or Z axis.
* [Meteor Launching Mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/meteorlaunching/) Integration - skill-based combat! (kind of.) Hitting an anglerfish with a meteor will stun them temporarily, depending on where you hit them:
  * Body - 1 second
  * Left/Right Cheek - 2 seconds
  * Mouth Floor - 3 seconds
