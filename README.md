* Chase Speed - how fast anglerfish move when chasing you. Default is 42.
* Investigate Speed - how fast anglerfish move when investigating a sound. Default is 20.
* Turn Speed - how fast anglerfish rotate when moving. Default is 180.
* Quick Turn Speed - how fast anglerfish rotate in place. Default is 360.
* Deaf - anglerfish no longer hear you. If you're being chased, this won't stop them from chasing you (same as default behavior).
* Mute - anglerfish no longer make sounds.
* Spin Axis - spins the anglerfish around an axis. Spin speed depends on Quick Turn Speed. Default is None.
  * Values are X, Y, or Z axis.
* [Meteor Launching Mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/meteorlaunching/) Integration - hitting an anglerfish with a meteor will stun them temporarily, depending on where you hit them:
  * Body - 1 second
  * Left/Right Cheek - 2 seconds
  * Mouth Floor - 3 seconds
